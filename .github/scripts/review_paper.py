Embodied AI Safety Taxonomy (5 layers):

1. PERCEPTION
   - Visual Perception: adversarial patches, object detection attacks, camera spoofing
   - Auditory Perception: voice command attacks, audio adversarial examples
   - Spatial Perception: depth estimation attacks, LiDAR spoofing
   - Motion Perception: optical flow attacks, action recognition robustness
   - Cross-Modal Perception: multi-modal fusion vulnerabilities

2. COGNITION
   - Instruction Understanding: prompt injection, jailbreak on VLMs/LLMs
   - World Model: world model robustness, causal reasoning under attack
   - Reasoning: logical reasoning attacks, chain-of-thought manipulation

3. PLANNING
   - Task Planning: LLM planner jailbreak, goal hijacking
   - Trajectory Planning: motion planning adversarial attacks, path manipulation
   - Multi-Agent Planning: coordination attacks, goal conflicts in multi-agent systems

4. ACTION
   - Robot Control: physical adversarial attacks, control policy backdoors
   - Human-Agent Interaction: social engineering, trust manipulation, HRI safety
   - Multi-Agent Collaboration: Byzantine agents, collusion, infection

5. AGENTIC
   - Tool Use: tool poisoning, malicious API calls, MCP attacks
   - Memory: memory poisoning, retrieval manipulation
   - Self-Evolving: fine-tuning attacks, knowledge editing attacks
   - Cascading Risks: supply chain attacks, emergent multi-agent risks

SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a senior researcher in embodied AI safety reviewing paper submissions for the survey "Safety in Embodied AI: Risks, Attacks, and Defenses."

The survey covers attacks and defenses across the full embodied AI pipeline. Here is the taxonomy:

{TAXONOMY}

Your role is to:
1. Assess relevance to embodied AI safety (not just general ML safety or pure robotics without safety focus)
2. Suggest the correct taxonomy layer and subcategory
3. Give a brief, constructive review

Be direct and helpful. If a paper is clearly off-topic, say so kindly.

Provide:
1. **Relevance**: Is this paper relevant to embodied AI safety? (Yes / Marginal / No) — one sentence explanation
2. **Suggested Layer**: Which taxonomy layer(s) fit best?
3. **Suggested Subcategory**: Which specific subcategory?
4. **Brief Assessment**: 2-3 sentences on why this paper belongs (or doesn't) in the survey
5. **Decision**: Accept / Review Needed / Reject (with reason if rejecting)
