## Overview

Embodied AI integrates perception, cognition, planning, and interaction into agents that operate in open-world, safety-critical environments.
As these systems gain autonomy and enter domains such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and robotics, ensuring their safety becomes both technically challenging and socially indispensable.

**Capability-Risk Duality**: each layer of the embodied pipeline represents a capability expansion that introduces corresponding new vulnerabilities.

## Open Challenges

- **Multimodal Perception Fusion Fragility**: Cross-modal attacks exploiting inconsistencies between visual, auditory, and spatial perception remain underexplored.
- **Planning Under Jailbreak**: LLM-based planners are vulnerable to instruction manipulation that bypasses safety constraints in physical execution.
- **Human-Agent Interaction Trust**: Open-ended scenarios where agents must negotiate trust with humans lack standardized safety evaluation.
- **Agentic Cascading Failures**: Self-evolving agents with persistent memory and tool use can propagate inner-layer compromises to system-wide failures.
- **Benchmark Standardization**: Lack of unified safety benchmarks across the full embodied AI pipeline hinders reproducible evaluation.
